        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Quesadillas are a quick meal on their own right. I love to serve them with fresh salads, black beans or pinto beans, and Mexican soups.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h4>Per Quesadilla</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 whole-grain flour tortilla (about 8 inch diameter)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup freshly grated cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1/4 cup cooked black beans or pinto beans, rinsed and drained</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped red bell pepper or jarred roasted bell pepper or a few thinly sliced cherry tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped red onion or green onion</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped pickled jalapeno (if you like heat)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon avocado oil, melted butter or extra-virgin olive oil, for brushing</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a medium skillet over medium heat. Warm your tortilla for about 30 seconds, flipping halfway. Flip once more, then sprinkle one-half of the tortilla with about half of the cheese. Cover the cheese evenly with the remaining fillings: beans, bell pepper, onion and jalapeno (if using).</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the remaining cheese over the fillings, and fold over the empty side of the tortilla to enclose the fillings. Quickly brush the top of the quesadilla with a light coating of oil, then carefully flip it with a spatula.</li>
            <li>Let the quesadilla cook until golden and crispy on the bottom, about 1 to 2 minutes, reducing the heat if necessary to prevent burning the tortilla. Brush the top with a light coating of oil, then flip it and cook until the second side is golden and crispy.</li>
            <li>Immediately remove the skillet from the heat and transfer the quesadilla to a cutting board. Let it cool for a minute to give the cheese time to set, then use a chef's knife to slice it into 3 pieces. Serve promptly, with any sauces or garnishes that you'd like.</li>
        </ol>
